About the benchmark:
====================

The intent of this benchmark is to develop a compact application that has 
multiple analysis techniques (multiple kernels) accessing a single data 
structure representing a weighted, directed graph. In addition to a kernel to 
construct the graph from the input tuple list, there will be three additional 
computational kernels to operate on the graph. Each of the kernels will require
irregular access to the graph's data structure, and it is possible that no 
single data layout will be optimal for all four computational kernels.  

The benchmark specification document (HPCS-SSCA2_Graph-Theory_v2.1) is included 
in this directory. This code is the benchmark reference sequential 
implementation in C.

Buiding:
========

Review the compiler path and flags in Makefile. Just doing a "make" in this
directory will build the executable SSCA2.

Running:
========

./SSCA2 <s>
where "s" is the problem SCALE (a positive integer). A SCALE value of k 
generates a directed graph of n=2^k vertices and m=8*n edges.
